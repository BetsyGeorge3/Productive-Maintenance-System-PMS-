## This project implements an IoT-based Predictive Maintenance System to monitor motor vibration data, detect anomalies, and predict equipment failures using an LSTM model. The workflow involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment on a cloud platform for real-time monitoring.
